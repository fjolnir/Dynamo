This is a cross platform(win/mac) library for building sprite based games.
Started as a part of a project for school.

Dependencies:

 * SDL ('sdl' in homebrew on OS X)
 * libogg ('libogg' in homebrew on OS X)
 * libvorbis ('libvorbis' in homebrew on OS X) 
 * Mini-XML ('libmxml' in homebrew on OS X)
 * libpng (Comes with X11 for OS X)
 * OpenAL (Pre installed on OS X)

NOTE: Currently the makefile only builds for OS X. I haven't gotten around to running things on windows yet.
